The (Data) Science of Kpop: Understanding BTS through Data and A.I.
Many media outlets have raised and answered their own question of what makes BTS so unique compared to other K-pop groups. Their answers, whether from Vox or Time magazine, aren't really well-supported by evidence, such as the claim that BTS is unique because of "confucian values" or "group synchrony". Fortunately, we have data science, where we can use both traditional and cutting-edge techniques to scientifically explore BTS' true uniqueness, if such a thing exists. This notebook examines two major aspect of BTS: their songs and their lyrics. As many fans have claimed that BTS' lyrics are different compared to their competitors (as well as their music), We will examine and answer these two major claims in this notebook. This analysis will help us to compare the qualities of the top performing artists and songs to devise a way to find out if a certain song will be successful on Billboard. As BTS is known to be billboard number 1 artists.
